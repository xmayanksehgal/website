            <h4>The Project</h4>
            <p>Since the dawn of time, humanity has never ceased to learn – individually as well as collectively. Over millennia, we have mastered an incredibly large number of skills, and continue to do so; yet, we lack a comprehensive and organised database of all human skills.</p>
            <p>We firmly believe that with the power of modern technology, it is possible to map out all human skills. However, the only smart way of doing so, is by leveraging collective knowledge and making everyone a part of this effort. In this age of advanced social tools, big data technologies and data science applications, imagine what we could do with this data!</p>
            <h4>Our Mission</h4>
            <p>Our aim is to build the largest and most accurate multilingual skills database ever made, by allowing a diverse and skilful community to contribute their individual skills to the global map. This database is available for anyone to use, free of charge with a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">licence</a>.</p>
            <p>Because the data is the result of many people’s voluntary effort, along with ours, we allow anyone to <a href="https://www.paywithapost.de/post_payments/b5cea20f-35cc-45f6-8249-b6b6792dff17">export the data as a CSV</a>, and plan to eventually make an API through which users can get access to it as well.</p>
            <h4>How Can You Help?</h4>
            <p>In our graph structure, each skill can be split into more specific sub-skills. What you need to do is add your own skills in the most appropriate section.</p>
            <p> You don’t need an account to <a href="/skills" alt="<?= _("The skills"); ?>">browse the skill database </a> or to download it. However, if you want to add your skills or share thoughts about existing ones, you will need to sign up.</p>
            <p> You can even apply to become an editor. Editors have the ability to edit skills added by other users. </p>

                <h4>What is a skill?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>It’s anything that you can do, which is important to you in your work, or in your life in general. Even seemingly trivial skills can be really important for some people.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h4>Are there any illegal skills?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>Every country has laws about what people can and cannot do. We do not consider listing a skill which is illegal to perform in some countries to be illegal itself. However, Skill Project is not a place to openly promote illegal and/or immoral activities, so expect the Editors to delete or flag inappropriate skills.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-q">
                <h4>Is there any way to link directly to a skill?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>Sure! Open the Edit panel for any skill and click on “Share” for its URL address, that you can copy and paste anywhere. When you open the URL, the tree will automatically expand right up to the selected skill.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-q">
                <h4>Is it possible for the same skill to exist in two (or more) different branches?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>Yes, absolutely. But as fas as the database is concerned, these will be two different skills (only with the same name). We believe that many skills could have different meanings based on their place in the database. Like “Photo Editing”, which could be classified under “Arts” as well as under “Computer Sciences” or “Technology”).</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-q">
                <h4>Is something like “Breathing” or “Walking” considered a skill?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>Remember what we call a “skill”. </p>
                    <q>
                        It’s anything you can do, which is important to you in your daily work, or in your life in general. Even seemingly trivial skills can be really important for some people.<br />
                    </q>
                    <p>
                        Ask a Yoga teacher if breathing is a skill. Sure it is! And what about race-walking?<br />

                        So yes, they are skills. But if it’s not immediately obvious to you how, it may be better to leave adding one to someone who actually masters the skill, as these people are usually better at locating them correctly within the tree.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-q">
                <h4>Is knowledge considered a skill in Skill Project?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>Generally, yes, because we have a broad definition of a skill that is not limited to physical actions. For example, we believe “music” is a skill. A very general one, but still a concept that can relate to something one can learn, teach, master, excel at, etc. Of course, if you know music, chances are you also know many sub-skills of music.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-q">
                <h4>Do skills have to be job or employment related?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>No, they don’t need to be related to a job. On the other hand, we struggled to think of any skill that was not at least partially connected to a job, if not for you, for someone else somewhere.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>How do I add a skill?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>First, you must <a class="login-link" href="/login" title="<?= _("Sign in!"); ?>">be logged in</a>. If you don’t yet have an account, head over to the <a class="register-link" href="/register" title="<?= _("Register!"); ?>">Sign up form</a>.<br />
                        Then, click on the “+” button on a skill that's related to the skill you want to add. This will open a panel with the “Create Skill” option.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-q">
                <h4>Why do you limit the number of children a skill can have?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>If we didn’t, some skills would have hundreds or even thousands of sub-skills (think about the spoken languages for example). That wouldn’t make a very nice tree. Nor would it be easy to explore.<br />
                        On the other hand, we noticed that it’s always possible to group skills together in such a way that the total number of skills in each group is always relatively small. This becomes obvious for skills you master because you can usually see that they naturally belong to different groups.<br />
                        At the moment, we are limiting to 10 sub-skills, but we might slightly raise this limit in the future if it’s a problem. Do raise the issue on the <a href="https://t.me/skill_project" title="<?= _("Skill Project's Community"); ?>">community forum</a> if it’s bothering you.</p>

                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>You have all editing rights on the skills you've just created, but only for one day... so review your work quickly!</p>

                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>If you just created the skill, you can edit it for one day. Otherwise, you can suggest the new name to an Editor by writing a message in the “Discuss the skill” section of the skill’s panel. Or you can <a href="" alt="<?= _("The skills"); ?>">apply to become an Editor yourself</a>!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-q">
                <h4>Why doesn’t everyone have editing rights? Like on Wikipedia?</h4>
                <div class="faq-a">
                    <p>Unfortunately, sometimes we have to plan for the worst. Wreaking havoc on the tree is just a few clicks away, when you have editing rights. Because our data has an intrinsic hierarchical form, it is very easy to vandalize a few skills (on the top levels) for a very visible effect.<br />
                        But we are constantly thinking about new and creative ways to moderate the system. If you have any ideas, we’ll be glad to hear from you on the <a href="https://t.me/skill_project" title="<?= _("Skill Project's Community"); ?>">community forum</a>.</p>
